* Task 1: Here we have two users making changes to the master branch of the repository. We also created four different text files by working on our own remote repositories. We made changes one at a time so as to avoid conflict. 
* Task 2: We see a conflict because User B didn't pull the changes to file2.txt before tried to make changes to it. We resolved the problem by User B pulling first and then concatenating the changes. Then both changes are present and User B can push the changes.

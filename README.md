User A: Erica Wong 

User B: Bryana Gutierrez 

Responses: 
* Task 1: Here we have two users making changes to the master branch of the repository. We also created four different text files by working on our own remote repositories. We made changes one at a time so as to avoid conflict. 
* Task 2: We see a conflict because User B didn't pull the changes to file2.txt before tried to make changes to it. We resolved the problem by User B pulling first and then concatenating the changes. Then both changes are present and User B can push the changes.  
* Task 3: We made changes using a different branch and we commited these changes to the master branch. There were still conflicts.
* Task 4: We worked in two different branches and made changes to different files. This worked better because there was no conflict.
* Task 5: We were working on different branches, but on the same file, so when User A tried to push her changes there was a conflict. To resolve this conflict we combined the changes in file1.txt, committed those changes and then tried to push and merge branch Task5A with master again.
